<!--Possible Javascript interview question. Syntax-wise, this is correct. So when you click on the buttons,
why does nothing happen??-->

<button id="btn-0">Button 1</button>
<button id="btn-1">Button 2</button>
<button id="btn-2">Button 3</button>

<Script type="text/javascript">
    const prizes = ['A Unicorn', 'A Hug', 'Fresh Laundry'];
    for (var btnNum= 0; btnNum < prizes.length; btnNum++) {
        //For each button, when the user clicks it..
        document.getElementById('btn-${btnNum}').onclick = () => { /*The issue happens here. The anonymous 
            function we're assigning to the buttons, 'btn-S' has access to var in the scope outside of it,
            aka a closure. In this case,it has access to 'btnNum', defined in the for loop.*/
            /*When a function accesses a var outside of its scope, it accesses that var, not a frozen copy.
            When the value held by the var changes, the function gets that new value. When the user presses 
            the buttons, the for loop already completes and btnNum will be 3. That is what each of the 
            anonymous functionss gets for btnNum.*/
            /*Why is btnNum 3 and not 2? The for loop increments btnNum until the conditional in the middle
            (btnNum < prizes.Length) is no longer met. The code in the for loop won't run with btnNum = 3, but 
            btnNum will be 3 when the loop is done.*/
            /*The result is undefined, because prizes has 3 elements, but they are at indices 0, 1, 2. 
            In JS, accessing a nonexistent index in an array results in undefined (Python throws an 
            IndexError. Ruby returns nil)*/
